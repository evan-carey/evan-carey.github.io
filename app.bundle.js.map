You can also use {\\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForm = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgForm, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function NgForm(validators, asyncValidators) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._submitted = false;\n        this.ngSubmit = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this.form =\n            new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__model__[\"a\" /* FormGroup */]({}, __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__shared__[\"a\" /* composeValidators */])(validators), __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__shared__[\"b\" /* composeAsyncValidators */])(asyncValidators));\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForm.prototype, \"submitted\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._submitted;

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__model__[\"b\" /* FormControl */]();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"d\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"e\" /* isPropertyUpdated */])(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this);

Conversely,\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\\@link FormControl} instance directly.\n * Simply create a {\\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the\n * {\\@link FormControlDirective}.\n *\n * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\\@link FormControlName},\n * it does not require that your {\\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\n * {\\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\\@link FormGroupDirective} that\n * exists above it.\n *\n * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in\n * {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\\@link FormControl},\n * or you can set it programmatically later using {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar FormControlDirective = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlDirective, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function FormControlDirective(validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6__shared__[\"d\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlDirective.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} isDisabled\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (isDisabled) { __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__reactive_errors__[\"a\" /* ReactiveErrors */].disabledAttrWarning();

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web.

See a full list of available properties in {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating\n * the {\\@link FormArray}, or you can set the value programmatically later using the\n * {\\@link FormArray}'s {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}\n * methods.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the array, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link FormArray}'s {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also\n * listen to its {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n * status is re-calculated.\n *\n * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {\\@link FormArray} dynamically by\n * calling its {\\@link FormArray.push} method.\n *  Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArrayName, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._validators = validators;\n        this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this._checkParentType();\n        this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n        }\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (looseIdentical(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web.
